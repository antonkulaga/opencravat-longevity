Then the identified variants were examined in 37 centenarians and 252 healthy controls.,"All tested centenarians with both Mt8414T and Mt3010A carried Mt5178A. Mt5178A was related to longevity, and Mt5178C carriers were more susceptible to adult-onset diseases than those with Mt5178A."
350,non-significant,American (Utah),,TP53,22506048,"354 individuals (18 - 95 years, mean age 55.35 ± 19.16 y; 175 females (20–95 years, mean age 55.44 ± 19.15 years) and 179 males (18–92 years, mean age 55.27 ± 19.22 years) were classified into four age groups as 20–40, 41–60, 61–80, >80. Then, IL-6 and MT2A polymorphisms were genotyped for longevity association study.",MT2A polymorphism was statistically analyzed in according to age groups and significant association was detected (p < 0.05). MT2A −5 G− carriers are more advantageous for longevity.
375,significant,Finnish,,TP53,12483296,"Inherited mtDNA markers were analyzed between a sample of individuals selected for successful aging and longevity (212 subjects older than 100 years and in good clinical condition) and a sample of 275 younger individuals (20–75 years, median age 38 years) carefully matched as to sex and geographic origin",Male centenarians emerged in northern Italy as a particular sample: 1) mtDNA haplogroup frequency distribution was different between centenarians and younger individuals (P=0.017 by permutation tests); and 2) the frequency of the J haplogroup was notably higher in centenarians than in younger individuals (P=0.0052 by Fisher exact test). MtDNA  inherited variability could play a role in successful aging and longevity.

In the Japanese cohort, C allele did not differ between centenarians and healthy controls, but it was significantly lower in centenarians than in CAD controls."
